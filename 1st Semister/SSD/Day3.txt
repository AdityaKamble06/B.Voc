***Importance of Planning:***

#Meaning:#
Planning can be defined as “thinking in advance what is to be done, when it is to be done,
how it is to be done and by whom it should be done”. In simple words we can say, planning
bridges the gap between where we are standing today and where we want to reach.
Planning involves setting objectives and deciding in advance the appropriate course of
action to achieve these objectives so we can also define planning as setting up of objectives
and targets and formulating an action plan to achieve them.
Another important ingredient of planning is time. Plans are always developed for a fixed
time period as no business can go on planning endlessly.

#1. Planning contributes to Objectives:
Planning starts with the determination of objectives. We cannot think of planning in
absence of objective. After setting up of the objectives, planning decides the methods,
procedures and steps to be taken for achievement of set objectives. Planners also help and
bring changes in the plan if things are not moving in the direction of objectives.
For example, if an organisation has the objective of manufacturing 1500 washing machines
and in one month only 80 washing machines are manufactured, then changes are made in
the plan to achieve the final objective.

#2. Planning is Primary function of management:
Planning is the primary or first function to be performed by every manager. No other
function can be executed by the manager without performing planning function because
objectives are set up in planning and other functions depend on the objectives only.

#3. Pervasive:
Planning is required at all levels of the management. It is not a function restricted to top
level managers only but planning is done by managers at every level. Formation of major
plan and framing of overall policies is the task of top level managers whereas departmental
managers form plan for their respective departments. And lower level managers make
plans to support the overall objectives and to carry on day to day activities.

#4. Planning is futuristic/Forward looking:
Planning always means looking ahead or planning is a futuristic function. Planning is never
done for the past. All the managers try to make predictions and assumptions for future and
these predictions are made on the basis of past experiences of the manager and with the
regular and intelligent scanning of the general environment.

#5. Planning is continuous Ongoing process:
Planning is a never ending or continuous process because after making plans also one has
to be in touch with the changes in changing environment and in the selection of one best
way.

***Introduction to Marketing:***
Marketing identifies market opportunities and comes out with appropriate strategies for
exploring those opportunities profitably.
It has to implement marketing programme and evaluate continuously the effectiveness
of marketing-mix. It has to remove the deficiencies observed in the actual execution of
marketing plans, policies, and procedures. It looks after the marketing system of the
enterprise.

Marketing management smoothen the process of exchange of ownership of goods and
services from seller to the buyer. Marketing management, like all other areas of
management comprises of the function of planning, organising, directing coordinating
and controlling.

Marketing management is the process of decision making, planning, and controlling the
marketing aspects of a company in terms of the marketing concept, somewhere within
the marketing system. Before proceeding to examine some of the details of this process,
comments on two aspects will be helpful background.

The marketing concept is simple in principle but often very difficult, if not impossible, to
fully implement. Adam Smith’s comment cited above is most consistent with it. The
concept is that a company can more effectively serve its own objectives if it will integrate
the various aspects of its marketing activities explicitly so as to meet the preferences of
its customers.

Traditionally, markets were viewed as a place for exchange of goods and services between
sellers and buyers to the mutual benefit of both. Today, marketing is exchange of values
between the seller and the buyer. Value implies worth related to the goods and services
being exchanged. The buyer will be ready to pay for the goods if they have some value for
him.

Marketing is the business function that controls the level and composition of demand in the
market. It deals with creating and maintaining demand for goods and services of the
organization.

It deals with creating and regulating the demand and providing goods to customers for
which they are willing to pay a price worth their value.
Marketing Management performs all managerial functions in the field of marketing.
Marketing Management identifies market opportunities and comes out with appropriate
strategies for exploring those opportunities profitably. It has to implement marketing
programme and evaluate continuously the effectiveness of marketing-mix. It has to

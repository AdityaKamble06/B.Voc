***Introduction to effective writing:***
Important tips for effective writing are mentioned as below:

#1. Know Your Goal and State It Clearly

Do you want the reader to do something for you, or are you merely passing along
information? Do you want a response from the reader, or do you want him to take action?
Effective written communication has a clear purpose, and that purpose is communicated to
the reader. Explain in clear terms what you want the reader to do.

#2. Use the Correct Tone for Your Purpose

Tone can help your writing be more effective. Certain forms of communication,
like memorandums and proposals, need a formal tone. Writing to someone you know well
would need a more informal tone. The kind of tone depends on the audience and purpose
of the writing.

#3. Keep Language Simple

Do not overuse clichés, jargon, and expressions or try to impress with big words. This can
make the reader work harder, and you want to make it easy to understand what you’re
saying.

#4. Stay on Topic and Keep It Concise

Effective written communication stays on topic. Avoid information that is not relevant.
Clarity is key. Less is more when it comes to length. Keep sentences and paragraphs short
and concise, since long, complicated sentences will slow the reader down. Leave out words
that do not contribute to the main focus of the communication.

#5. Use Active Voice

Using an active voice will strengthen your writing. It’s easier to understand sentences that
are written in the active voice. An active example is "I caught the ball," and a passive
example is "The ball was caught by me." Active voice will engage the reader and keep his or
her attention.

#6. Have Someone Proofread Your Writing

Good grammar and punctuation are very important. It is a good idea to have someone else
proofread your writing before you send it. If you cannot do that, then try reading it out
loud.


***Types of Nonverbal Communication:***
Some different types of Nonverbal Communication are mentioned as below:

#1) Facial Expressions:

Facial expressions are responsible for a huge proportion of nonverbal communication.1 Consider
how much information can be conveyed with a smile or a frown. The look on a person's face is
often the first thing we see, even before we hear what they have to say.
While nonverbal communication and behavior can vary dramatically between cultures, the facial
expressions for happiness, sadness, anger, and fear are similar throughout the world.

#2) Gestures
Deliberate movements and signals are an important way to communicate meaning without
words.2 Common gestures include waving, pointing, and using fingers to indicate numeric
amounts. Other gestures are arbitrary and related to culture.
In courtroom settings, lawyers have been known to utilize different nonverbal signals to attempt
to sway juror opinions. An attorney might glance at his watch to suggest that the opposing
lawyer's argument is tedious or might even roll his eyes at the testimony offered by a witness in
an attempt to undermine his or her credibility.
These nonverbal signals are seen as being so powerful and influential that some judges even
place limits on what type of nonverbal behaviors are allowed in the courtroom.

#3) Paralinguistics
Paralinguistics refers to vocal communication that is separate from actual language.3 This
includes factors such as tone of voice, loudness, inflection, and pitch. A cold tone of voice might
suggest that you are actually not fine, but you don't wish to discuss it. A bright, happy tone of
voice will reveal that you are actually doing quite well. A somber, downcast tone would indicate
that you are the opposite of fine and that perhaps your friend should inquire further.

#4) Body Language and Posture
Posture and movement can also convey a great deal of information. defensive postures, armcrossing, and leg-crossing, While these nonverbal behaviors can indicate feelings and attitudes,
research suggests that body language is far more subtle and less definitive than previously
believed.

#5) Eye Gaze
The eyes play an important role in nonverbal communication and such things as looking, staring
and blinking are important nonverbal behaviors. When people encounter people or things that
they like, the rate of blinking increases and pupils dilate. Looking at another person can indicate
a range of emotions including hostility, interest, and attraction.
People also utilize eye gaze as a means to determine if someone is being honest. Normal, steady
eye contact is often taken as a sign that a person is telling the truth and is trustworthy. Shifty eyes
and an inability to maintain eye contact, on the other hand, is frequently seen as an indicator that
someone is lying or being deceptive.

#6) Haptics
Communicating through touch is another important nonverbal behavior. There has been a
substantial amount of research on the importance of touch in infancy and early childhood.
Harry Harlow's classic monkey study demonstrated how deprived touch and contact impedes
development. Baby monkeys raised by wire mothers experienced permanent deficits in behavior
and social interaction. Touch can be used to communicate affection, familiarity, sympathy, and
other emotions.

#7) Appearance
Our choice of color, clothing, hairstyles, and other factors affecting appearance are also
considered a means of nonverbal communication.8 Research on color psychology has
demonstrated that different colors can evoke different moods. Appearance can also alter
physiological reactions, judgments, and interpretations.

#8) Artifacts
Objects and images are also tools that can be used to communicate nonverbally. On an online
forum, for example, you might select an avatar to represent your identity online and to
communicate information about who you are and the things you like.
People often spend a great deal of time developing a particular image and surrounding
themselves with objects designed to convey information about the things that are important to
them.
Uniforms, for example, can be used to transmit a tremendous amount of information about a
person. A soldier will don fatigues, a police officer will wear a uniform, and a doctor will wear a
white lab coat. At a mere glance, these outfits tell people what a person does for a living.

***SWOT analysis:***
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and so a SWOT
Analysis is a technique for assessing these four aspects of your business.
You can use SWOT Analysis to make the most of what you've got, to your organization's
best advantage. And you can reduce the chances of failure, by understanding what you're
lacking, and eliminating hazards that would otherwise catch you unawares.
you can start to craft a strategy that distinguishes you from your competitors, and so
compete successfully in your market.

***Strengths***
Strengths are things that your organization does particularly well, or in a way that
distinguishes you from your competitors. Think about the advantages your organization
has over other organizations. These might be the motivation of your staff, access to certain
materials, or a strong set of manufacturing processes.
Your strengths are an integral part of your organization, so think about what makes it
"tick." What do you do better than anyone else? What values drive your business? What
unique or lowest-cost resources can you draw upon that others can't? Identify and analyze
your organization's Unique Selling Proposition (USP), and add this to the Strengths
section.

***Weaknesses***
Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your organization, so focus on your
people, resources, systems, and procedures. Think about what you could improve, and the
sorts of practices you should avoid.
Once again, imagine (or find out) how other people in your market see you. Do they notice
weaknesses that you tend to be blind to? Take time to examine how and why your
competitors are doing better than you. What are you lacking?

***Opportunities***
Opportunities are openings or chances for something positive to happen, but you'll need to
claim them for yourself!
They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what
might happen in the future. They might arise as developments in the market you serve, or
in the technology you use. Being able to spot and exploit opportunities can make a huge
difference to your organization's ability to compete and take the lead in your market.
Think about good opportunities you can spot immediately. These don't need to be gamechangers: even small advantages can increase your organization's competitiveness. What
interesting market trends are you aware of, large or small, which could have an impact?

***Threats***
Threats include anything that can negatively affect your business from the outside, such as
supply chain problems, shifts in market requirements, or a shortage of recruits. It's vital to
anticipate threats and to take action against them before you become a victim of them and
your growth stalls.
Think about the obstacles you face in getting your product to market and selling. You may
notice that quality standards or specifications for your products are changing, and that
you'll need to change those products if you're to stay in the lead. Evolving technology is an
ever-present threat, as well as an opportunity!
Always consider what your competitors are doing, and whether you should be changing
your organization's emphasis to meet the challenge. But remember that what they're doing
might not be the right thing for you to do, and avoid copying them without knowing how it
will improve your position.

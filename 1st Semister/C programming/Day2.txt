***Algorithm***
An Algorithm is a process or step by step instruction for solving a problem they
form the foundation of writing a program.

An algorithm is a sequence of instructions that carried out to pre-determine.
Sequence in order to solve a problem or complete a work.

The word algorithm means "A set of finite rule or instructions to be followed in Calculation or other 
problem solving operation.

***Features of Algorithm***
1)Input :- Algorithm must recieved input that can be represented as value or data.
2)Output:- The Algorithm produce some output it can be consequence of a problem or
           a solution desgined to solve it.
3)Finiteness:- The algorithm required limited steps it means that it shoould be excited 
               after executing a certain numbers of command.
4)Validity:- The Algorithm must be valid in other words it should be able to produce solution through 
             the problem that the algorithm is designed to solving a resonable ammount of time.
5)Effectiveness:- An algorithm must be effective meaning that it must be able to produce a solution to
                  the problem it is desgined to solving a resonable ammount of time.
6)Generality:- An algorithm must be general meaning that it can be applied to a wide range of problem 
               rather than mean specific to a single problem.

#Basic writing of Algorithm
Example:- The sum of two integers.

Step 1:- Get Started.
Step 2:- Declare three integers a,b,c.
Step 3:- Define the values of a and b.
Step 4:- Add the values of a and b.
Step 5:- Save the output of step 4 in c.
Step 6:- Print C.
Step 7:- Stop.

#Advantages of Algorithm
1)Speed and efficiency:- Algorithm can process large amount of data quickly and accurately making them usefull 
                         for task that are too time consuming or error-prone for people to perform.
2)Consistency:- Algorithm follows a set of perdetermined guidelines it can produce consitance result.

3)Automation:- Algorithm can perform task automatically leaving people to focus all more complex all
               creative task.
4)Increased a      :- Achieve high level algorithm can often achieve high level of accuracy than human.
                      is specially when dealing it large amount of data
5)Better decision making:- Algorithm help us to make both inform and objective decision and analysing 
                           of the data.




1)Limited Scope:- Algorithm cana solved only problems with their scope and me not be able to solve 
                  complex problem.
2)In sufficient transparency:-Many algorithm cancel the process through which they are to the consume.
                              Thiss called make it tough to thing about or check to resume it.
3)Reliance on the finess of the data:-

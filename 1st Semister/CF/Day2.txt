    control unit hold info

The major sections of a CPU
1)Conrtol Unit
2)Arithmetic Logic Unit

1)Control Unit:- a.The Control Unit of a CPU controls all the activities and operation of the computer.
b.It is also responsible for controlling input or output and memories and other device connected to the CPU.
c.The control unit act like a supervise which determine the sick rays in which computer programm and instructions 
are executed.

2)Arithmetic Logic Unit:- The data inputed to input device is store in the primary storage unit.
a.The ALU perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication another logical control
unit logical control unit logical operation and or,equal,greater than,less than.
b.The info are the data is transmit to arithmetical unit from a storage unit only than it is
required after completing the operation.The result is either written to the storage unit for 
further processing letting store.

# Memory Units => 1)Memories Units is an essential part of the computer system which is used to store data 
and instructions before and after processing.
2)The memory unit transmit the information to other unit of the computer system when required.
3)There are two types of memory units 
a.Primary b.Secondary

a.Primary Memory:- 1)The Primary Memory can not store a vast amount of data.
The data stored primary memory is temparory the data will be lost if they are disconnected from power supplies.
The primary in usually store the input data and immediately calculate result.
2)The primary memory also known as the main random access memory(RAM) is an example of primary memeory usually be 
 a.Volatile    b.Semiconductor   c.Secondary memory

1)The use of primary memories is not possible data permantely for future
